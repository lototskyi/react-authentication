# authentication in react

This project actually contains two projects:
- A React.js application (i.e., the frontend SPA)
- A dummy backend API to which the React app can "talk" (to send + fetch data)

You must run "npm install" in both project folders.

You have to start both fronend and backend via "npm start" in the frontend folder as the project uses the third party lib "concurently"

You MUST have both servers (backend + frontend) up and running for the projects to work.

The dummy backend API does not use any external database - instead the dummy data is saved to an "events.json" file inside the project folder.
